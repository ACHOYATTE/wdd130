    <p>And he obtained a bpromise of the Lord,that out of the fruit of his loins the Lord God would raise up a crighteous dbranch</p>
    <p>unto the house of Israel; not the Messiah, but a branch which was to be broken off, nevertheless, to be remembered in the </p>
    <p>covenants of the Lord that the Messiah should be made emanifest unto them in the latter days, in the spirit of power, unto</p>
    <p>the bringing of them out of fdarkness unto lightâ€”yea,out of hidden darkness and out of captivity unto freedom.</p>
